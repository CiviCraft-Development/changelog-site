![CiviCraft Placeholder Image](../../assets/0.0.png) 

Hey there, future CiviCraft players! We‚Äôre thrilled to give you a peek at what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes as we develop CiviCraft, currently in version 0.0. Our team is actively developing a one-of-a-kind city roleplay experience where players can explore and live in a beautiful city, collaboratively built and brought to life!

### üöÄ Why Launch a Changelog Site?

With CiviCraft still in development, we want to keep you in the loop on every step of our journey. Here‚Äôs why we‚Äôre releasing a dedicated changelog site:

- **Real-Time Updates:** Our changelog site will provide a centralized location to track all feature releases, enhancements, and fixes as they roll out.
- **Transparency First:** By sharing our progress here, you can see the direction CiviCraft is taking and watch as new capabilities come to life.
- **Everything in One Place:** Setting up a dedicated changelog site means you don't have to spend time searching for what's new or what's changed. You can find everything here without the hassle!

In the future, this changelog will merge with our main site. Additionally, more improvements will be made! For now, it serves as a dedicated space to keep you up-to-date on our latest milestones.

### üåê What‚Äôs Coming to CiviCraft?

While we‚Äôre still in development, here‚Äôs a general overview of what we're planning to bring to the server:

- **Realistic City Life:** Experience an immersive city with systems for housing, school, jobs, health, politics, and so much more that feel like real life.
- **Dynamic Roleplay System:** Every player can take on exciting roles that shape CiviCraft‚Äôs lively city, where your choices truly matter.
- **Creativity & The Arts:** Express yourself through arts, theater, film, and more -- CiviCraft is built to be a canvas for the creatives.
- **Vibrant Economy:** Engage in a thriving player-led economy, start businesses, influence city politics, and make your mark on the world.
- **Inclusive Community:** We‚Äôre building a non-toxic, welcoming environment where players from all walks of life can connect, collaborate, and have fun.

There‚Äôs so much more in store, and we can‚Äôt wait to reveal it all as features come together. Our team is excited to welcome players on this journey with us!
