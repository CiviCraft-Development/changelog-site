# CiviCraft Changelog

Welcome to the CiviCraft Changelog repo, which serves as a central tracker for all updates, changes, and new features developed for the CiviCraft server. Designed to keep players and contributors informed, the changelog captures each stage of pre-launch development and will continue to be updated post-launch.

## Key Components

- **Feature Tracking** – Lists new gameplay features and major updates.
- **Enhancement Logs** – Records improvements and optimizations for gameplay and performance.
- **Bug Fixes** – Tracks resolved issues, ensuring transparency on ongoing improvements.

### Future Development

The changelog will be expanded and integrated into CiviCraft’s main website as launch nears. Search and feedback functions will also be coming in future updates.

Thanks for following along with CiviCraft’s progress!
